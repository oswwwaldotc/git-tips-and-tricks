# 🧨 How to Generate and Resolve a Merge Conflict in Git

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To intentionally create a merge conflict in Git and demonstrate how to identify and resolve it using the command line and your code editor.

---

## 🛠️ Steps to Generate a Merge Conflict

1. ### Initialize a New Git Repository

   ```bash
   mkdir git-merge-conflict-demo
   cd git-merge-conflict-demo
   git init
   ``` 

2. ### Create an Initial File and Commit

   ```bash
   echo "Hello from main branch" > conflict.txt
   git add conflict.txt
   git commit -m "Initial commit on main"
   ```

3. ### Create a New Branch and Modify the File

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   echo "Change from feature branch" > conflict.txt
   git commit -am "Update conflict.txt in feature branch"
   ```

4. ### Switch Back to Main and Modify the Same File

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   echo "Change from main branch" > conflict.txt
   git commit -am "Update conflict.txt in main branch"
   ```

5. ### Try to Merge the Feature Branch into Main

   ```bash
   git merge feature-branch
   ```

   At this point, Git will detect that `conflict.txt` was changed differently in both branches and will throw a merge conflict.

---

## 🧩 Understanding the Merge Conflict Output

After the merge attempt, you'll see output like:

```
Auto-merging conflict.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in conflict.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

And the `conflict.txt` file will look like:

```bash
<-<<<<<-< HEAD
Change from main branch
=======
Change from feature branch
>->>>>>-> feature-branch
```

This means Git couldn't decide which line to keep. It shows the content from `main` (HEAD) and the content from `feature-branch`.

---

## 🧹 Steps to Resolve the Merge Conflict

1. ### Open the File in Your Code Editor

   Decide how you want to resolve the conflict. For example:

   ```bash
   Hello from both branches!
   ```

   Replace the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) with your chosen version.

2. ### Mark the Conflict as Resolved

   After saving the resolved file:

   ```bash
   git add conflict.txt
   ```

3. ### Complete the Merge

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict between main and feature-branch"
   ```

---

## ✅ Verify the Resolution

Run `git log` or `cat conflict.txt` to confirm that the correct content is committed.

# 🖥️ Resolving Git Merge Conflicts in VS Code

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To demonstrate how to resolve merge conflicts using the built-in conflict resolution tools in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), making the process more visual and beginner-friendly.

---

## 🔄 Prerequisites

You’ve already:

* Initialized a Git repository.
* Created and committed conflicting changes in two branches.
* Attempted to merge the branches, resulting in a conflict.

---

## 👣 Steps to Resolve Merge Conflict in VS Code

### 1. Open the Repository in VS Code

If your project isn't already open in VS Code, navigate to it in the terminal and run:

```bash
code .
```

This opens the folder in VS Code.

---

### 2. Check for Conflicts

Once VS Code detects a conflict, you’ll see indicators in the Source Control panel and in the affected files themselves.

* In the file tree, files with merge conflicts will have a yellow triangle icon.
* In the editor, the conflicted file will display special markers like:

```bash
<-<<<<<-< HEAD
Change from main branch
=======
Change from feature branch
>->>>>>-> feature-branch
```

---

### 3. Use VS Code’s Conflict Resolution Interface

When you open the conflicted file, you’ll see VS Code shows "Current Change" (your branch) and "Incoming Change" (the branch you’re merging in). You’ll get options like:

* Accept Current Change – Keeps your branch’s version
* Accept Incoming Change – Keeps the feature branch’s version
* Accept Both Changes – Merges both versions together
* Compare Changes – Lets you see a side-by-side diff

> 🔧 Recommended: Choose Accept Both Changes and then edit the result as needed.

You can also manually edit the file to clean up and merge lines yourself if you prefer custom output.

---

### 4. Edit the File (If Necessary)

Once you've accepted one or both changes, VS Code removes the conflict markers. You can now fine-tune the combined content.

For example, you might change:

```bash
Hello from both branches!
```

---

### 5. Mark the Conflict as Resolved

Go to the Source Control panel (`Ctrl+Shift+G` or click the Git icon on the sidebar).

You’ll see a "✔" (check mark) next to the file. Click it to stage the resolved file, or use the terminal:

```bash
git add conflict.txt
```

---

### 6. Complete the Merge

Once all conflicts are resolved and staged:

```bash
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in VS Code"
```

---

## ✅ Confirm Everything Worked

Check your file contents:

```bash
cat conflict.txt
```

And review your commit log:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

---

## 💡 Bonus Tip: Enable GitLens (Optional)

The [GitLens extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) enhances Git integration in VS Code, showing blame annotations, history, and advanced merge insights.

# 🏷️ Git Tagging – Exercises

## 🎯 Purpose

To help learners understand how to create, list, inspect, delete, and push Git tags to mark release points or specific versions in a project's history.

---

## 📦 Exercise Setup

1. Create a Git Repository for Practice

   ```bash
   mkdir git-tagging-exercises
   cd git-tagging-exercises
   git init
   ```

2. Create a Simple Project File

   ```bash
   echo "# Git Tagging Demo" > README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

3. Add More Commits to Simulate Versions

   ```bash
   echo "v1.0 feature complete" >> README.md
   git commit -am "Add v1.0 feature"

   echo "v2.0 improvements" >> README.md
   git commit -am "Add v2.0 improvements"
   ```

---

## 🧪 Exercises and Instructions

### ✏️ Exercise 1: Create Lightweight and Annotated Tags

Task:
Create a lightweight tag named `v1.0` on the first commit and an annotated tag named `v2.0` on the second commit.

Hints:

* Use `git log` to get commit hashes.
* Use `git tag <tag>` and `git tag -a <tag> -m "message"`.

---

### ✅ Solution 1:

```bash
git log --oneline
# Example Output:
# a1b2c3d Add v2.0 improvements
# e4f5g6h Add v1.0 feature
# i7j8k9l Initial commit

git tag v1.0 e4f5g6h        # lightweight tag
git tag -a v2.0 -m "Release version 2.0" a1b2c3d  # annotated tag
```

---

### ✏️ Exercise 2: List and Inspect Tags

Task:
List all existing tags and show the details of `v2.0`.

---

### ✅ Solution 2:

```bash
git tag                # lists all tags
git show v2.0          # shows details of the annotated tag
```

---

### ✏️ Exercise 3: Tag the Current Commit

Task:
Make a new commit and tag it with `v3.0` (annotated). Use a meaningful message for the tag.

---

### ✅ Solution 3:

```bash
echo "v3.0 security fixes" >> README.md
git commit -am "Add v3.0 security patch"

git tag -a v3.0 -m "Release version 3.0 with security updates"
```

---

### ✏️ Exercise 4: Delete a Tag Locally and Remotely

Task:
Delete tag `v1.0` locally. Then simulate pushing and deleting it from a remote.

---

### ✅ Solution 4:

```bash
git tag -d v1.0                      # delete locally

# Simulate a remote (only if you have a remote):
# git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0    # delete remotely
```

> 💡 You must have a remote set up to test remote tag deletion. Use a GitHub repo or `git remote add`.

---

### ✏️ Exercise 5: Push and Fetch Tags

Task:
Push all tags to a remote repository and verify they are uploaded. Then clone the repo in a new folder and verify the tags exist.

---

### ✅ Solution 5:

```bash
git remote add origin <remote-url>
git push origin --tags          # push all tags

# In another terminal
git clone <remote-url> clone-test
cd clone-test
git tag                         # verify tags exist
```

---

# 🏷️ Extra Exercise: Tagging a Range of Commits

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To practice tagging a range of related commits, such as for a feature set, bugfix series, or milestone, and understand how to reference and work with them meaningfully.

---

## 📦 Exercise Setup

If you're continuing from the previous tagging exercises, great. If not, run this to simulate a range of commits:

```bash
mkdir tag-range-demo && cd tag-range-demo
git init

echo "start" > app.txt
git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"

echo "feature A" >> app.txt
git commit -am "Add feature A"

echo "feature B" >> app.txt
git commit -am "Add feature B"

echo "feature C" >> app.txt
git commit -am "Add feature C"

echo "hotfix 1" >> app.txt
git commit -am "Apply hotfix 1"
```

---

## ✏️ Exercise Task

Create a tag named `milestone-1` that represents the completion of features A, B, and C.

You should:

1. Use `git log` to find the commit hash of the last feature (C).
2. Annotate that commit with a tag `milestone-1`.
3. Use `git log` with a range to show all commits from the previous tag (if any) or from the initial commit to `milestone-1`.

---

## ✅ Solution

### 1. Get the Commit Hash for "feature C"

```bash
git log --oneline
# Example output:
# d1e2f3g Apply hotfix 1
# c3d4e5f Add feature C
# b2c3d4e Add feature B
# a1b2c3d Add feature A
# 0123abc Initial commit
```

### 2. Tag the Feature Milestone

```bash
git tag -a milestone-1 c3d4e5f -m "Feature milestone 1: A, B, C complete"
```

### 3. View the Tagged Commit

```bash
git show milestone-1
```

### 4. List the Commits in the Milestone Range

Assuming no earlier tag:

```bash
git log 0123abc..milestone-1 --oneline
```

If you had an earlier tag (like `v0.1`), you could do:

```bash
git log v0.1..milestone-1 --oneline
```

---

## 🧠 Tip for Advanced Use

While Git tags point to a single commit, you can use ranges and naming conventions to group multiple commits under a milestone or feature set, using:

```bash
git log <start>..<end>
```

You can also use `git describe` to find the nearest tag and get a readable identifier:

```bash
git describe milestone-1
```
